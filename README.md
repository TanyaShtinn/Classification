 Project objectives:
- Business goal: to determine the characteristics by which it is possible to identify customers
 who are more inclined to open a deposit in a bank, and thereby increase the effectiveness of a marketing campaign.

- Technical goal: to build a machine learning model that, based on the proposed characteristics of the client,
  will predict whether he will take advantage of the offer to open a deposit or not.
